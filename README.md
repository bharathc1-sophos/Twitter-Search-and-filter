# Twitter-Search-and-filter
Run the program by command below 
$python test1.py
If any error exists with raw_input, Then you might be using python version 3 so for error free program use either 
python version 2 or change raw_input to input.

After starting the program please give valid inputs whenever the program asks for input.

For filters I have written filter function, It can take any argument and filter the results. With a good front end 
design The function can easily filter the results.

Finally if needed the csv function will resturn tweets in csv format
